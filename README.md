# Day-7
data engineer journey
# Day 7 - [Review and Catch up]

## What I Learned
- Today I went back and reviewed list I also spent time doing the coding challeges, learning about imports and debugging my code
## Challenges Faced
- This was a good chance to review but I still feel behind I want to devote more time to the basics before learning anything new because if I move forward without being able to at least do the challeges I don't think I will have a good grasp
## Code Highlights
```
I was able to create the random number generator, it'll be interesting to try and refactor to be a function
